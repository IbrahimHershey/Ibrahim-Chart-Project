    <p> Columbine was the first mass shooting in the United States that sent total shockwaves to the public. Americans at the time did not understand who would do such a thing and questioned why it happened in school. Columbine occurred in 1999 and we are in the year 2023, almost 2024, and the number of gun deaths as a result of school shootings have increased.

    <p> So the big question is why? Why do school shootings keep happening? Why are so many students dying? When will it stop? No matter how many school shootings there are, it seems that after a couple days or weeks, we forget about it until another one unfortunately happens.

    <p> But there are interesting arguments to this problem which is the possession of guns in a classroom setting. Should teachers have guns? Should students have guns? Should they wear bulletproof vests?

    <p> William Pelfrey Jr, who was not available for an interview is a Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He talked about school shootings in the United States in a recent article. â€œSchool shootings happen in the U.S. at an alarming rate, but they rarely happen elsewhere in the world. Eighty or 90 percent of all the school shootings in the world happen in the U.S. They are concentrated here," said Pelfrey Jr.<a href="https://www.news.vcu.edu/article/2022/06/why-do-school-shootings-keep-happening-in-the-united-states"> Credit: Why do school shootings keep happening in the United States?</a>
